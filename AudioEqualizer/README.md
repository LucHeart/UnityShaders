# Audio Equalizer
This is a modified version of Leviants Audio Equalizer Shader.

## Why?
The Original version used a audio spectrum texture which would needed to be predefined. This version uses Audio Link which eliminates the need for any predefined spectrum texture.

## Features
- Audio Link
- Fall Off is defineable by texture
- You can set a texture as the background (also the video's render texture)
